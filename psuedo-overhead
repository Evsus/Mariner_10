transmit(activity){
transmit from pc to exchange #activation signal
    tcp transmit?  #Constant signals may not work as expected... Use a step/interval operation 
    handle exchange data
receive data from exchange
    translate to arduino code
    send to arduino
Arduino
    does task
    sends update about servo position
        back to exchange
        back to pc
            pc updates
}

input data from controller
    {
        #java or html overlay that supports buttons
        if button(activity){ #different buttons per activity
        transmit(activity)
        }
