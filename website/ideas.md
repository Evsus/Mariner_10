# Ideas

`Note: If you have any ideas, add a new bullet point following the formating of the others`

For our club to store information on ongoing and past projects that we wish to share with the public.
We may not want to share our entire repository with the communities as we are entering competitions
in which our first goal is to learn, but our second is to win (for now). With a website, we can allow
people from the community or other robotics clubs to see what we did and possibly how it works (with
information given being at our discretion). This could possibly bring in funding from businesses
that are interested or bringing in new members. This is all about publicity and getting the word
out.

We may want to contemplate including:

+ A mission statement

   - Why are we doing what we're doing? What do we hope to gain?
+ A roster

   - With small bio for each? What our role on the team is? Things we've accomplished inside of the club?
   - Gives our club a face (or multiple) so people get to know us
+ A schedule of events

   - Meetings, competition dates, deadline dates (could help us keep track)
+ Previous and ongoing projects list

   - One page per project? Allowing us to completely show off previous projects and everything about
   them
+ Contact

  - May seem weird, but what if someone has a question about our club or wants to sponsor us?
  How would they get ahold of us directly?
  
  `Do we want a school email for our club? Or would we like to have an e-mailing list that is under
  the guise of an email address? (Think devops@dewv.net)`
